# simple_stories_train

Project for training small LMs. Designed for training on SimpleStories, an extension of [TinyStories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759).

## Installation

From the root of the repository, run one of

```bash
make install-dev  # To install the package, dev requirements and pre-commit hooks
make install  # To just install the package (runs `pip install -e .`)
```

## Development

Suggested extensions and settings for VSCode are provided in `.vscode/`. To use the suggested
settings, copy `.vscode/settings-example.json` to `.vscode/settings.json`.

There are various `make` commands that may be helpful

```bash
make check  # Run pre-commit on all files (i.e. pyright, ruff linter, and ruff formatter)
make type  # Run pyright on all files
make format  # Run ruff linter and formatter on all files
make test  # Run tests that aren't marked `slow`
make test-all  # Run all tests
```

## Usage
Training a simple model:
`python simple_stories_train/train_llama.py --model d2 --sequence_length 1024 --total_batch_size=4096`

You may be asked to enter your wandb API key. You can find it in your [wandb account settings](https://wandb.ai/settings). Alternatively, to avoid entering your API key on program execution, you can set the environment variable `WANDB_API_KEY` to your API key.
